# 10 Docker Projects to Master Docker

Welcome to my Docker projects repository! í ½íº€ This repository contains source codes and configurations for **10 Docker-based projects**, ranging from basic containerization to advanced deployment strategies using Kubernetes and CI/CD automation.

## Projects Overview

### **Beginner-Level Projects**

#### 1. Basic Web Application with Docker
- **Goal:** Learn to containerize a Flask/Node.js application.
- **Key Concepts:** Writing a `Dockerfile`, building an image, and running a container.
- **Files:** `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`

#### 2. Multi-Container Application with Docker Compose
- **Goal:** Set up multiple services (Web + Database) using Docker Compose.
- **Key Concepts:** `docker-compose.yml`, networking between containers.
- **Files:** `app.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`

#### 3. Persistent Data Storage with Docker Volumes
- **Goal:** Use named and bind mounts for data persistence in a database container.
- **Key Concepts:** `docker volume`, MySQL/PostgreSQL persistent storage.

#### 4. Docker Networking: Communication Between Containers
- **Goal:** Understand container communication using custom networks.
- **Key Concepts:** Creating and managing Docker networks.

#### 5. Scaling Applications with Docker Swarm
- **Goal:** Deploy a scalable service using Docker Swarm.
- **Key Concepts:** Load balancing, `docker swarm` commands, cluster management.

### **Advanced-Level Projects**

#### 6. Secure Docker Deployment with Traefik and Let's Encrypt
- **Goal:** Set up a reverse proxy with SSL encryption.
- **Key Concepts:** Traefik configuration, HTTPS with Let's Encrypt, Basic Authentication.
- **Files:** `traefik.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`

#### 7. Scalable Microservices Architecture with Docker and Kubernetes
- **Goal:** Deploy multiple microservices with an API Gateway.
- **Key Concepts:** Kubernetes deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and scaling.
- **Files:** `k8s/deployment.yaml`, `k8s/service.yaml`

#### 8. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) for Dockerized Applications
- **Goal:** Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions/Jenkins.
- **Key Concepts:** CI/CD pipelines, pushing images to Docker Hub, deploying via automation.
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/docker.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`

#### 9. Multi-Stage Docker Build for Optimized Production Deployment
- **Goal:** Reduce Docker image size using multi-stage builds.
- **Key Concepts:** Optimized `Dockerfile`, running Flask with Gunicorn, Nginx as a reverse proxy.
- **Files:** `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`

#### 10. Optimized Docker Image Deployment with Kubernetes
- **Goal:** Deploy an optimized Docker image to Kubernetes.
- **Key Concepts:** Kubernetes Services, scaling with replicas, environment variable management.
- **Files:** `k8s/deployment.yaml`, `k8s/service.yaml`
